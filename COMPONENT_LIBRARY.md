## How to Use These Components

### Option A: Keep Current Partners Page (Recommended)
The `/about/partners` page already has all this content. Just refactor it to use components:

```tsx
// app/about/partners/page.tsx
import { SurgeonTestimonials } from "@/components/surgeon-testimonials"
import { TechnologyPartners } from "@/components/technology-partners"
import { AdditionalPartners } from "@/components/additional-partners"
import { PartnershipBenefits } from "@/components/partnership-benefits"

export default function PartnersPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <HeroSection />
        <SurgeonTestimonials />
        <TechnologyPartners />
        <AdditionalPartners />
        <PartnershipBenefits />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Option B: Create Separate Clinicians Page
Use the Clinical Excellence component + Surgeon Testimonials:

```tsx
// app/about/clinicians/page.tsx
import { ClinicalExcellence } from "@/components/clinical-excellence"
import { SurgeonTestimonials } from "@/components/surgeon-testimonials"

export default function CliniciansPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <HeroSection title="Clinicians We Work With" />
        <ClinicalExcellence />
        <SurgeonTestimonials />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Option C: Combined Clinicians & Partners Page
Use all components together:

```tsx
// app/about/clinicians-partners/page.tsx
import { ClinicalExcellence } from "@/components/clinical-excellence"
import { SurgeonTestimonials } from "@/components/surgeon-testimonials"
import { TechnologyPartners } from "@/components/technology-partners"
import { AdditionalPartners } from "@/components/additional-partners"
import { PartnershipBenefits } from "@/components/partnership-benefits"

export default function CliniciansPartnersPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <HeroSection title="Clinicians & Partners" />
        {/* Clinicians Section */}
        <ClinicalExcellence />
        <SurgeonTestimonials />
        
        {/* Partners Section */}
        <TechnologyPartners />
        <AdditionalPartners />
        <PartnershipBenefits />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Option D: Mix & Match Anywhere
These components are now reusable! Add surgeon testimonials to ANY page:

```tsx
// app/services/hifu/page.tsx
import { SurgeonTestimonials } from "@/components/surgeon-testimonials"

export default function HifuPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <main>
        {/* HIFU content */}
        
        {/* Add testimonials at bottom */}
        <SurgeonTestimonials 
          title="What Surgeons Say About HIFU"
        />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Customization Examples

### Custom Testimonials
```tsx
const customTestimonials = [
  {
    name: "Dr. Jane Smith",
    title: "Chief of Radiology",
    quote: "Custom quote here...",
    image: "/path/to/image.jpg"
  }
]

<SurgeonTestimonials testimonials={customTestimonials} />
```

### Custom Partners
```tsx
const customPartners = [
  {
    name: "New Partner",
    logo: "/logo.png",
    description: "Description...",
    specialization: "What they do"
  }
]

<TechnologyPartners partners={customPartners} />
```

### Custom Benefits
```tsx
const servicebenefits = [
  {
    title: "Fast Setup",
    description: "Quick deployment..."
  }
]

<PartnershipBenefits 
  benefits={serviceBenefits}
  title="Why Choose Our Service"
/>
```

## Content Gaps to Address

### Where Testimonial Themes Are NOT Fully Expanded:

1. **"Pleasure to work with"** (Laniado)
   - No page specifically about the human/professional side
   - Could add: Team culture section? More about Application Specialists?

2. **"IEP transfer"** (Hindley)
   - Mentioned in testimonial but not explained anywhere
   - Could add: Technical workflow section explaining IEP

3. **"Helps patients understand"** (Nigam)
   - Patient-facing benefits not emphasized much
   - Could add: Patient resources section? Example reports?

4. **Graphic reports** (Nigam)
   - Mentioned but no examples shown
   - Could add: Sample report images/gallery

---

## Summary: Best Alignment

### **Carousel Should Show:**
1. Dr Clare Allen contouring (Hindley theme)
2. Application Specialist support (Laniado theme)
3. Fusion accuracy screen (Nigam theme)

5. Equipment ready (Laniado theme)
6. IEP/MRI workflow (Hindley theme)
7. Graphic reports (Nigam theme)
8. Team working together (All themes)

- âœ… Before â†’ During â†’ After is intuitive
- âœ… Each part has clear visual and theme

**Recommended:**

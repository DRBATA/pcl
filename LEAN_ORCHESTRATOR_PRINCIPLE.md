# The Lean Orchestrator Principle

## 🎯 **Core Concept: Don't Overload the Agent**

```
❌ WRONG: Orchestrator carries everything
✅ CORRECT: Orchestrator coordinates, subagents fetch
```

---

## 🚫 **What We Were Doing Wrong**

### **The Bloated Orchestrator:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Context bloat
orchestrator.process({
    "all_cases": [100+ cases with full details],
    "all_emails": [1000+ email threads],
    "all_hospitals": [50+ hospital records],
    "all_equipment": [20+ equipment items],
    "all_theatre_slots": [500+ available slots],
    "email_log": [Full history],
    "surgeon_preferences": {...},
    ...
})

# Claude receives 50KB of context
# Costs: $$$$
# Speed: Slow (10+ seconds)
# Accuracy: Confused by too much info
# Result: Hallucinations, mistakes
```

**Problems:**
- 💰 **Expensive**: 50,000 tokens per request
- 🐌 **Slow**: 10+ seconds to process
- 🤯 **Confused**: Too much information
- 🎲 **Unreliable**: Hallucinates details

---

## ✅ **What We Should Do**

### **The Lean Orchestrator:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Minimal context
orchestrator.state = {
    "current_bucket": "wants_to_proceed",
    "num_cases_in_bucket": 2,
    "last_action": "check_groupability"
}

# That's it. 3 fields. ~50 bytes.

# Claude receives minimal state
# Costs: $
# Speed: Fast (1 second)
# Accuracy: Focused, clear
# Result: Reliable decisions
```

**Benefits:**
- 💰 **Cheap**: 50 tokens per request (1000x reduction)
- ⚡ **Fast**: <1 second response
- 🎯 **Focused**: Sees only what matters
- ✅ **Reliable**: Clear decision-making

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Orchestrator's Job:**
```python
class LeanOrchestrator:
    def process(bucket_state):
        # 1. Know WHERE you are
        current_bucket = detect_active_bucket(bucket_state)
        
        # 2. Know WHAT to do
        if current_bucket == "unsorted":
            action = "call_analyzer_subagent"
        elif current_bucket == "wants_to_proceed":
            action = "call_grouping_subagent"
        
        # 3. Call subagent (subagent fetches data)
        result = await call_subagent(action)
        
        # 4. Make decision based on subagent report
        if result["viable"]:
            return "Book slot"
        else:
            return "Wait for more cases"
        
        # Orchestrator never saw the actual case data!
        # Subagent handled all the heavy lifting
```

### **Subagent's Job:**
```python
class GroupingSubagent:
    async def check_groupability():
        # 1. Fetch data from Supabase
        cases = await supabase.query("SELECT * FROM cases WHERE bucket = 'wants_to_proceed'")
        
        # 2. Do calculations
        num_cases = len(cases)
        profit = (num_cases * 1200) - 1200
        
        # 3. Return ONLY the result
        return {
            "num_cases": num_cases,
            "profit": f"£{profit:,}",
            "viable": num_cases >= 3,
            "recommendation": "Ready to book" if num_cases >= 3 else f"Need {3 - num_cases} more"
        }
        
        # Subagent fetched everything
        # Subagent did the work
        # Orchestrator just receives the summary
```

## 📊 **Context Size Comparison**

| Approach | Context Size | Cost/Request | Speed | Accuracy |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Bloated** | 50,000 tokens | $0.50 | 10s | Low |
| **Lean** | 50 tokens | $0.0005 | 1s | High |
| **Reduction** | **1000x less** | **1000x cheaper** | **10x faster** | **Better** |

## 🎯 **The Division of Labor**

### **Orchestrator Knows:**
1. ✅ Current bucket (state machine position)
2. ✅ Which tool to call next
3. ✅ How to interpret subagent reports
4. ❌ NO case details
5. ❌ NO email history
6. ❌ NO hospital lists

### **Subagents Know:**
1. ✅ How to fetch specific data
2. ✅ How to analyze that data
3. ✅ How to return summary
4. ❌ NO awareness of other subagents
5. ❌ NO orchestration logic

---

## 🔄 **Example Workflow**

### **Scenario: Check if cases can be grouped**

#### **❌ OLD WAY (Bloated):**
```
1. React sends ALL case data to orchestrator (50KB)
2. Orchestrator sends ALL to Claude
3. Claude processes everything
4. Claude calculates profitability
5. Claude returns answer
6. Cost: $0.50, Time: 10s
```

#### **✅ NEW WAY (Lean):**
```
1. React sends minimal state: {"bucket": "wants_to_proceed", "num_cases": 2}
2. Orchestrator sees: "Ah, wants_to_proceed bucket, call grouping subagent"
3. Orchestrator: await call_grouping_subagent()
4. Grouping subagent: Fetches cases from Supabase, calculates, returns summary
5. Orchestrator receives: {"viable": false, "need": 1}
6. Orchestrator: "Surgeon, wait for 1 more case"
7. Cost: $0.0005, Time: 1s
```

---

## 💡 **Real-World Example**

### **Surgeon asks: "Can I book these cases?"**

#### **Lean Orchestrator Response:**
```python
# Step 1: Orchestrator checks state
state = {
    "current_bucket": "wants_to_proceed",
    "num_cases": 2
}

# Step 2: Orchestrator decides which tool
tool = "check_groupability"

# Step 3: Orchestrator calls subagent
result = await grouping_subagent.check()
# Subagent fetches data, calculates, returns:
# {"num_cases": 2, "profit": "£1,200", "viable": False, "need": 1}

# Step 4: Orchestrator makes decision
return {
    "answer": "Not yet",
    "reason": "Only 2 cases = break even. Need 1 more for £2,400 profit",
    "action": "Chase more patients"
}

# Total context sent to Claude: ~100 tokens
# Total time: <1 second
# Total cost: $0.0005
```

#### **Old Bloated Orchestrator Would Have:**
```python
# Sent ALL cases (100+ with full details)
# Sent ALL emails (1000+ threads)
# Sent ALL hospitals (50+ with slots)
# Claude processes 50,000 tokens
# Takes 10 seconds
# Costs $0.50
# Might hallucinate details
# Might miscalculate
```

## 🎨 **Orchestrator System Prompt (Lean)**

```
You are a workflow coordinator.

Your ONLY job:
1. Look at current bucket state
2. Decide which subagent to call
3. Receive subagent report
4. Make decision
5. Tell surgeon what to do

You do NOT:
- Store case details (subagents fetch them)
- Store email history (subagents fetch them)
- Store hospital lists (subagents fetch them)
- Do calculations yourself (subagents do them)

Your tools:
- call_analyzer_subagent() → Analyzes unsorted cases
- call_grouping_subagent() → Checks profitability
- call_equipment_subagent() → Checks availability
- call_theatre_subagent() → Finds slots
- call_email_subagent() → Drafts emails

Example:
Input: {"bucket": "wants_to_proceed", "num": 2}
You: call_grouping_subagent()
Subagent: "2 cases = break even, need 1 more"
You: "Surgeon, wait for 1 more case"

Stay lean. Delegate everything. Decide fast.
```

**Note:** Prompt is ~200 tokens. Old prompt would be ~10,000 tokens with all the context.

## 🚀 **Implementation Pattern**

### **Orchestrator (Minimal State):**
```python
class LeanOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = None  # Set dynamically
        
    async def process(self, bucket_state):
        # Extract ONLY essential state
        self.state = {
            "current_bucket": detect_active_bucket(bucket_state),
            "num_cases": len(bucket_state[current_bucket])
        }
        
        # Decide which subagent
        if self.state["current_bucket"] == "unsorted":
            return await self._call_analyzer()
        elif self.state["current_bucket"] == "wants_to_proceed":
            return await self._call_grouping()
    
    async def _call_analyzer(self):
        # Subagent fetches data, does work
        result = await AnalyzerSubagent.analyze()
        
        # Orchestrator just interprets result
        if result["matches"]:
            return {"action": "suggest", "cases": result["matches"]}
        else:
            return {"action": "wait"}
    
    async def _call_grouping(self):
        # Subagent fetches data, calculates
        result = await GroupingSubagent.check()
        
        # Orchestrator just interprets result
        if result["viable"]:
            return {"action": "book"}
        else:
            return {"action": "wait", "need": result["need"]}
```

### **Subagent (Does the Work):**
```python
class GroupingSubagent:
    @staticmethod
    async def check():
        # 1. Fetch data (orchestrator doesn't have it)
        cases = await supabase.query(
            "SELECT * FROM cases WHERE bucket = 'wants_to_proceed'"
        )
        
        # 2. Do calculations
        num_cases = len(cases)
        profit = (num_cases * 1200) - 1200
        viable = num_cases >= 3
        
        # 3. Return summary ONLY
        return {
            "num_cases": num_cases,
            "profit": f"£{profit:,}",
            "viable": viable,
            "need": max(0, 3 - num_cases),
            "recommendation": "Ready" if viable else f"Need {3 - num_cases} more"
        }
```

## ✅ **Key Takeaways**

1. **Orchestrator = Coordinator, not database**
   - Knows WHERE (state)
   - Knows WHAT (which tool)
   - Doesn't know HOW (subagent does that)

2. **Subagents = Workers**
   - Fetch their own data
   - Do their own calculations
   - Return summaries only

3. **Benefits**
   - 1000x cheaper
   - 10x faster
   - More accurate
   - More reliable

4. **Pattern**
   - Minimal state in orchestrator
   - Subagents fetch on-demand
   - Return summaries, not raw data
   - Orchestrator makes decisions based on summaries

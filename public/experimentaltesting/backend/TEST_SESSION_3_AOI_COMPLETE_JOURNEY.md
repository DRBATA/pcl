## üêõ **COMMON ISSUES & FIXES**

### **Issue: Wrong email template sent**
- Check: Order type detection in webhook
- Check: Is booking_id present in order_items?
- If booking exists ‚Üí `aoi-booking-confirmation.tsx`
- If assessment exists ‚Üí `water-bar-receipt.tsx`

### **Issue: Drinks not paired with experience**
- Check: AI pairing logic in booking creation
- Check: `pre_drinks`, `during_drinks`, `after_drinks` in bookings table
- SQL: `SELECT pre_drinks, during_drinks, after_drinks FROM bookings WHERE id = 'BOOKING_ID';`

### **Issue: Stock not decreasing**
- Check: venue_id in cart_items
- Check: AOI venue ID matches: `20c2f440-9133-42ec-a8d6-6336e649ec4b`
- Check: migrate_cart_to_order RPC runs successfully

### **Issue: Booking payment_status not updating**
- Check: Webhook updates bookings table
- SQL: `SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE customer_email = 'EMAIL' ORDER BY created_at DESC;`
- Check: RPC includes booking update logic

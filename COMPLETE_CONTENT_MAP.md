## Content Consistency Issues

### Navigation Naming
- Header says "On-Site Fusion" ‚Üí links to `/services/fusion-biopsy`
- Footer says "MR/US Fusion Biopsy" ‚Üí same link
- Collection Strip says "MRI FUSION BIOPSY" ‚Üí links to `/services/freehand-fusion` ‚ùå **Different page!**

### About Section Confusion
- `/about/clinicians` exists (linked in footer) but is light
- `/about/partners` exists (linked in footer) and is rich
- `/about/clinicians-partners` exists (linked in header) but is placeholder
- **Decision needed:** Keep combined or separate pages?

### CTAs Need Functionality
Many pages have non-functional buttons:
- "Request Demonstration"
- "Technical Specifications"
- "Schedule Consultation"
- "View Clinical Data"

**Recommendation:** Either make functional or remove

---
